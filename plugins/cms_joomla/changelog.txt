Features:
---------
- The plugin occurs on event [onPrepareContent] instead of [onAfterDisplayContent].
- Tree wrappers are givens for developers, to be used in custom scripts:
  $TBS->JoomlaParams
  $TBS->JoomlaLimitstart
  $TBS->JoomlaArticle (object)
- The plugin merges [onload] tags. They are merged when the first plugin tag is processed.
- The plugin merges automatic tags only if permissions are accepted for the plugin tags.
- By default, the parameter 'sql' have some automatic replacements for more coding comfort:
   '+-' with '>'
   '-+' with '<'
  This can be cancelled by adding parameter 'sql_preserve'.
- New option 'VarPrefix' to limit the usage of PHP global variables in dynamic articles.

Optimizations:
--------------
- The plugin automatically choose the proper TBS version depending to the current PHP version (PHP 4 or PHP 5).
- Use TBS version 3.5.0.
- The pluging includes its main PHP script only if a plugin tag is found. Thus it is very light to run for common articles.
