Version 3.0, 2010-07-07

- New cache feature
- Can return records as objects
- Can return trace in a console, and can trace data in a grid
- New property Version (is it useful?)
- More compatibility with PHP 4
- Trace mode now works when TbsSQL is used within TinyButStrong

Version 2.6, 2009-11-26

- Argument $Mode has been added to the class instantiation and to method Connect().
  This allows to display error message and trace when the connection is made.
- Display the connection string in trace mode (Mode=TBSSQL_TRACE)
- New database support : ODBC (generic), for both Windows and Unix)  
- Support UnixODBC for ODBC Generic and ODBC for SQL Server.
- Use canonical formats for date and time with ODBC Generic and ODBC for SQL Server.
- Support ODBC connection string with ODBC and ODBC Generic for SQL Server.
- Do not use @ with odbc_connect() because some error of connection can make a PHP critical error.
  In this case @ avoid any error and warning messages which is uncomfortable.

Version 2.5, 2009-09-16

- New set of jokers that supports NULL values for SQL.
- constants that can be used for property $Db->Mode :
  TBSSQL_SILENT
  TBSSQL_NORMAL
  TBSSQL_DEBUG
  TBSSQL_TRACE
- Bug for TbsSQL with MySQL : each TbsSQL instance was always linked to the 
  last MySQL connection. That was because property $Db->Id was always set to True
  instead of the MySQL connection resource. 
- New property $Db->TbsKey : enables you to use several instances of TbsSQL with TinyButStrong.
- New method $Db->SetTbsKey() : enables you to customize instances of TbsSQL with TinyButStrong.
